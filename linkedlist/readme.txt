1) Mergeable heaps using linked lists.
Operations :
- Make_heap
- Insert
- Minimum
- Extract_min

2) Given a sorted linked list, search elements in list should have time complexity of O(Root n)

- Use randomization to get the key and then reduce the set. Check in Cormen.

3) Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list

- Remove by iterating over the list. Time would be in the order of O(n)

4) Find kth element from the last of a single linked list

5) Delete an element in a single linked list, given only that node as parameter.
